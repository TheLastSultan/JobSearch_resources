# Host a live front-end project using Github Pages

If you want to add a custom domain like www.awesomesite.com, follow this guide: [Link to set up a custom domain](./gh-pages-custom-domain.md)

### Note: Your project must have an index.html file, and no back-end.

+ In the settings menu of your github project repo, scroll down to the section called Github Pages.

![github-pages](https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/job-search/projects/js-project/gh-pages-images/github-pages.png)

+ Change the Source from **none** to **master** branch or **gh-pages** branch. It's recommended to create a gh-pages branch for github hosting, but it's up to you. Master works fine too. Commit and push to the chosen branch.

+ In an hour or so, your website will be available at {github username}.github.io/{repo_name} ex: johndoe.github.io/coolproject
