# Using Modules in the Browser

When writing for Node, we used `module.exports` and `require` to break
our code into modules, but web browsers do not have this functionality.
Later, we'll use a tool to help us out with that, but first it's
necessary to understand how modules work in the browser natively.

## Requiring Files

If we write front-end JavaScript in multiple files, we could explicitly
list each of them in our HTML document. Since browsers execute HTML from
the top down, each JavaScript file will be loaded in the order it is
listed. When dependencies are involved, this ordering is important: If
`lion.js` requires `animal.js` to be loaded first, then the HTML
document **must** list `animal.js` before `lion.js`.

```html
<body>
  ...

  <script src="zoo/animal.js"></script>
  <script src="zoo/lion.js"></script>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
```

Unlike Node, where each file has its own global namespace, in the
browser a single global namespace (called `window`) is shared
across all JavaScript files. If `animal.js` loads before `lion.js`, and
`animal.js` sets `window.Animal`, then when `lion.js` executes, it can
use `window.Animal`. Since there is no `require` in browser JS, this is
one way front end JS libraries can make their code available to other
libraries--by setting global variables.

This is much more like Ruby than Node in that there is a shared global
namespace across all the source files. However, unlike Ruby, the browser
doesn't have a `require` function, so you cannot specify dependencies
inside the file that requires them. You must keep track of these
yourself and ensure that your scripts are all loaded in the correct
order.

If the libraries are loaded in the wrong order then everything breaks in
confusing, unpredictable ways. You can imagine that this quickly becomes
unmaintainable and difficult to debug. What is an enterprising new front-end developer to do?

## Module Bundlers
There are wonderful tools that exist for the purpose of 'bundling' your
front-end code into digestible, bite-sized bits built for the browser. These tools will run through all your source files and bundle them into a single file you can include in your html with one script tag. Each file **requires** its dependencies explicitly at the top, and then **exports** the object it is responsible for making.

It does this via an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) to make sure that all of the libraries that require each other are loaded in the right order.

### Importing and exporting
Here's a typical approach to writing source files intended for
execution by the browser.

##### `./zoo/animal.js`:

```js
// ./zoo/animal.js
// Define an Animal class; export it as `Animal`. Save it
class Animal {
  eat() {
    // ...
  }
}

module.exports = Animal;
```

#### `.zoo/lion.js`
```js

const Animal = require('./animal.js');

//Inherit Lion from Animal
class Lion extends Animal {
  roar() {
    // ...
  }
};

module.exports = Lion;
```

##### `./app.js`:

```js
const Lion = require('./zoo/lion');
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(new Lion().roar());
}
```

We don't have to worry about loading these scripts in the right order because our module bundler will make sure to load any file declared in `require` before the rest of the code after that will depend on it.

Furthermore, by **only** exporting the objects we want, we protect the global namespace from pollution and name collisions. This allows us to mix in libraries with less fear and makes our code safer for other programmers to include.

## Webpack
If all of your source files `require` their dependencies and use `module.exports` to set their exports, then you are ready to use a module bundler to prepare your program for the browser.

First we need to get a module bundler. There are a few options, but we will use **Webpack** during the course.

### Getting Webpack
We will use `npm` to install Webpack as a command line tool. There will be more information later about how to use `npm`, but for now we just want to get you set up with Webpack.

Running the command `npm install -g webpack webpack-cli` will install and setup Webpack and its command line tools. Webpack is a very powerful (and extensible) tool. We will leverage many of its features as the course goes on, but for now we will just use it to bundle our JavaScript source files into one file.

To do this, navigate to your app directory and run `webpack app.js -o bundle.js --mode=development`. Webpack will find the file named `app.js` in the current directory and bundle it up with any files it requires, and any files those files require, until it has all the dependencies it needs. It will output this to a file called `bundle.js`. The `mode` flag tells Webpack to optimize this build for development, rather than production.

Your html file would then have a script tag for the bundled file like:
`<script src="bundle.js"></script>`

Work through tonight's homework to practice this!
