# JavaScript Project

This is an opportunity for you to showcase your JavaScript chops, practice good OOP design principles, and build something that really interests you. The best project will be one that showcases something unique about yourself. We're going to give you a lot of freedom to choose your own direction for this project. However, by the same token you will be expected to take ownership of your work. Hunt down bugs on your own, and search for answers to your problems online before you call over a TA. Although there will be office hours for the next few weeks, after that you will mostly be on your own. Practice motivation and self sufficiency this week.

## Project Guidelines

* Justify your use of libraries - don't include an entire library just because it quickly solves a small-scale problem. Instead, solve the problem yourself.
* Avoid using a game engine - think through the physics and write your own data structures.
* Choose a realistic project - you will only have one week to complete it, and there are other events going on this week as well.
* Demonstrate your front end skills - think through your aesthetic and UI/UX beforehand, and make sure your project leaves a good impression.
* Practice good workflow - even though you're working on your own, follow the [GitHub Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
* Practice good coding principles - good OOP principles may take more effort up front, but will save you enormous amounts of time in the long run
* No jQuery allowed!

## Proposal

* The implementation timeline is the most important part of your proposal. It is your job to stick to it during the week.
* Follow the template we have provided to write your proposal draft quickly on Monday morning (the next task in this module).
* After lecture on Monday, you will have the opportunity to discuss your proposal with a coach.
* The full proposal (including wireframes) is due on Tuesday at 9AM.

## Submitting Your Proposal

* Spend time on Monday evening writing an ironclad proposal and save it as the README for your project repo.
* Submit your proposal by adding links to your repo in Jobberwocky and hitting 'Queue for Review.'

## Resources

There are several modules included to get you started with common JS Project technologies. Review the ones which are useful to your own project.

## Adding a Back End

* Most games do not need a back end - they are built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) is a good alternative for some projects.
* Adding a back end of some kind to your project should not be your immediate goal and should not take time away from the main functionality of your project. It can always be added later. e.g., if you want to save the all-time high score, you should treat this as a bonus feature.
* The exception to this is the case where your project requires the use of an external API inaccessible from a browser. In this case, we have a simple Node backend setup you can use to setup and process your API calls quickly. There will be a demonstration of this on Tuesday during office hours.
