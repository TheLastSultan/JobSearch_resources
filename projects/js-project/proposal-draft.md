# JavaScript Proposal Draft

Welcome to day one of your JavaScript project! As with all great projects, we will start by making a detailed plan of execution. Over the next two hours, you will be writing a proposal draft to begin solidifying your project idea.

## Getting Started

* Create a GitHub repository for your project and include a `README`
* Submit your repo on Progress Tracker by selecting the JavaScript project, submitting your repo URL, and clicking 'Queue for Review'
* Follow the instructions below and write your proposal in the `README` 
* Make use of TA asssistance when needed, but try to practice independent decision making

## Outline

Follow this outline for your proposal:

```
* Project Title
* Background and Overview
    * Motivation for project
    * High level overview
* Functionality and MVP Features
    * Choose carefully
    * Be especially detailed
* Architecture and Technologies
    * Technology 1
        * Description
        * Justification
    * Technology 2
        * Description
        * Justification
    ...
Implementation Timeline
    * Most important category
    * Daily breakdown
    * Aim to be done by Friday
```

See the next task in this module for an example of a good JavaScript proposal following this outline.

## Examples

Here are some examples of good proposals (not that these are finished products):

* [Example 1](https://github.com/masonanders/Wormhole/blob/master/docs/proposal.md)
* [Example 2](https://github.com/stevielum1/viral_canvas/blob/master/docs/proposal.md)
* [Example 3](https://github.com/SecondCommand/GEOWars) (scroll down to First Week Goals)

## Moving Forward

Your full proposal is due tomorrow at 9AM. By this evening, you will have gotten the chance to discuss your proposal with the coaches (or they may have reached out to you with clarifying questions). You should only need to make minor changes based on that feedback and add wireframes.
