# Building a Chrome Extension

You already possess the toolkit you need to create a Chrome Extension since all they use is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If necessary, you can construct an API backend for it as well - this usually won't be needed.

Building a Chrome Extension is usually best to do if you're addressing a real need. The Chrome Web Store is more discerning, and is less interested in "toy" extensions. Ideally, you'll be building something that will have actual users.

1. Build a [test extension by following the tutorial][tutorial] and skim the extension overview and developer's guide to get a sense of what extensions can do.
2. Identify a real-world need. This could be as simple as "this game's official stats are not as user friendly as I would like", or a more complicated "I've always wanted to be able to synchronize the background of my Chrome homepage to NASA launches".
  * Remember, the flex project is the one project that can differentiate you from other bootcamp grads, so be sure to choose something that is complicated or useful enough to impress a potential employer.
3. Build the extension!
4. Don't forget to add a readme to the github repo and add the project to your resume.
5. [Submit to the Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish).  Most reviewers will not download your extension, so make the descriptions and screenshots excellent.  If your extension has complex features, consider posting a video walkthrough on youtube.
6. Get a few friends to download your extension and leave positive reviews. If you get good public reviews, use these downloads and reviews as the 1st bullet point under this project.
