# The Cover Letter
Do you feel like your application materials are going into a black hole?  Are you struggling to get screening interviews?  A key reason for this is likely because your cover letter is not tailored to employers.

Employers are busy and typically spend between 15-30 seconds scanning your materials.  If your materials aren’t tailored and don’t include keywords, it’s an easy reason to cut you from the screening interviews.

A strong cover letter shows that *you’ve done research on the company and that your skills are a good fit for the company*.  To increase your chances of getting a screening interview, below are key strategies for writing a compelling cover letter that will get your application noticed.

## Get Organized
Based on the research you’ve done, make an outline and list what you want to emphasize in each paragraph.  Your cover letter should include:

* An awesome opening paragraph that introduces who you are and why you are interested in the company.
* One to two paragraphs showcasing your skills and background that would make you a good fit for the company.
* A closing paragraph
(TOTAL LENGTH...About 1/2-1/3 page only)

# THE TRIANGLE-Point 1
Introduce yourself, the technologies you know, and your interest in the position.

* If possible, use the hiring manager’s name.  If you don't know the hiring manager's name, start with "Hi [Company Name] Team”.

### Have a GREAT OPENING LINE
Recruiters receive an enormous amount of materials to read...what will make you stand out right from the beginning?  If you were a Recruiter what would you rather see?

* I am a software developer with experience in React, Rails, and Javascript.   :-(
* I am an experienced software developer with a strong knowledge base in React, Ruby, Rails and Javascript (sort of ok)
* Looking for a rockstar software engineer who knows React, Ruby, Rails and Javascript?  (Gets attention)

As you know, in life, you do not get a second chance to make a first impression.  Grab them in the first sentence.

**OTHER GREAT OPENERS:**

DO NOT USE THESE OPENERS.  WRITE YOUR OWN.  

* Looking for a rockstar (or knowledgeable or experienced) software engineer who knows React, Ruby, Rails and Javascript?  I am (something company specific, like how you relate to their project/mission/industry) and I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with you to share with you my related projects and experience.

* Collaborating with teams, working efficiently and paying attention to detail is what I do best as a software engineer.  As a Developer I have (thorough knowledge, experience, skills ) with React, Ruby, Rails and Javascript.  I am (something company specific, like how you relate to their project/mission/industry) and I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with you to share with you my related projects and experience.

* Looking for an exceptional ** software engineer who knows React, Ruby, Rails and Javascript?**   I am (something company specific, like how you relate to their project/mission/industry) and I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with you to share with you my related projects and experience.

[This article][cover-letters-article] (and those it links to) can help you brainstorm original content.

* Note: Don’t call yourself a 'Full Stack' engineer.  While App Academy trained you in the full stack, calling yourself a 'full stack engineer' in is a little premature because 'Full stack' often means so experienced I can build whatever you throw at me.  For now just call yourself a software engineer or web developer.

* If relevant, include a sentence about your background (science, engineering, mathematics, CS, finance).
* Based on the research you’ve done from Phase 0, include a company blurb that show your interest in the company and its values.  Your company blurb should show *specific knowledge of the industry* or an understanding of *challenges specific to the company*.  Below are examples:

  * Weak: "I am excited to apply to GeneriCo because we both value awesome products and love traveling."
  * Strong: "I lived abroad, and the best travel experiences were the ones not yet in the Lonely Planet. I’d love to contribute to building this experience for other like-minded travelers as a web developer."

  * Weak: "I enjoy shopping online and especially like it when the experience is streamlined like on your site.”
  * Strong: "GeneriCo's userbase is growing fast. I've dealt with scaling databases and leveraged my mathematics background to develop faster algorithms that simultaneously enabled further growth and improved user experience."


# Triangle Point 2--ABOUT YOU

Based on the research you’ve done earlier, draft a few skills paragraphs that include technical and other skills that show you're an engineer capable of filling their position.  Your skills paragraph may include:
* A description of your fullstack, flex or other projects.  Make sure you provide a live link to the project you’re discussing. This might be  similar to your [resume bullet points][bullet-points] but not the exact same wording.
* A description of your other skills (teamwork, problem solving).
* A description of your unique background that may be helpful to the company (e.g., the company creates products for real estate agents, and you have a background in real estate).
* Based on the job description, include the skills paragraphs that are most relevant.  For example, if the job description lists JavaScript as a key skill, then the paragraph you include should emphasize your knowledge of JavaScript.

**MAKE IT DISTINCTIVE AND EASY FOR THE RECRUITER**
Recruiters have very limited time.  An idea might be to add BULLET POINTS and BOLD keywords or phrases.  The idea here is to use some of the top bullet points of their job description and relate it to what you do.  For example:

**Their job description bullet point:**
"You’ll use a diverse set of technologies including Node.js, NoSQL databases, and real-time message delivery systems"

**Your cover letter bullet point:**
"On my recent projects wwww.amazingproject.com I employed Node,js, NoSQL databases and have created an efficient and effective real-time message delivery system"

**BOLD**
Sometimes, to make it easier for the Recruiter it can be advantageos to BOLD a few keywords/phrases in your opening paragraph as well as in the body and/or bulleted sections of your cover.  For example:

Looking for an exceptional **software engineer who knows React, Ruby, Rails and Javascript?**   I recently saw on ________that you were looking for someone with these special skills and I would enjoy the opportunity to meet with you to share with you some of my related projects.

* On my recent projects wwww.amazingproject.com I employed **Node,js, NoSQL databases and have created an efficient and effective real-time message delivery system**

* Comfortable with **networking concepts, including HTTP and TCP/IP**

* **Strong understanding of data modeling and storage** with both NoSQL and relational databases



# Triangle Point 3 - ABOUT THEM
Now here is the place where you can show value.  What do you know about the company?  How would you be an asset specifically?

BAD EXAMPLE:  I know I would be a valuable asset to your team
GOOD EXAMPLE:  I know that your company works in Ruby and React and with my knowledge and my recent projects, I believe I would easily be able to acclimate to your projects and team.

REMEMBER:  They want to work with someone who can "hit the ground running"

### FINAL - APPRECIATION/THANK YOU

* Thank them for their time and reiterate your interest in the company/position.

* Include a live link to your portfolio site.

* Mention the materials you're sending along: résumé + github + link to a live project.

https://www.cybercoders.com/insights/top-5-resume-and-cover-letter-mistakes-for-software-engineers/


## Review Your Letter For Common Pitfalls
- [ ] Your cover letter is one page or shorter.
- [ ] Uses the same font as your Resume, and should be at least 11 point font.
- [ ] Uses the same header as your Resume.
- [ ] Only includes positive language that sells you as a candidate.  Excludes negative language that downplays your skills (“I don’t have much experience/a CS Degree, but I can . . .”).
- [ ] Includes the skills paragraphs that are relevant to the job description.
- [ ] Is addressed to the right person/company.
- [ ] Doesn’t have typos or broken links.
- [ ] Includes a company blurb that is specific to the company and doesn’t sound generic.

## Emailing Like A Boss
Some companies don't provide exact instructions on how to apply. If that's the case and you're applying via email, include your cover letter and résumé as attachments and also paste your cover letter in the body of the email.
* The subject line can be helpful to find your email in crowded inbox. "Junior Rails Engineer - New York" is more helpful than "Applying to CoolCompany, inc".
* Set up a signature with your mail client. Include the link to your portfolio site.  You could try something like this:

  Mark Zuckerberg
  markzuckerberg.com
  @finkd

## A BASE COVER LETTER TEMPLATE
Once you have a strong template cover letter, the process of writing a new cover letter should be more efficient.  We recommend spending 10-15 minutes to tailor each cover letter.
* Spend 5 minutes researching the company.
* Spend 5-7 minutes drafting and editing a company blurb tailored to the company.
* Spend 2 minutes choosing the skills paragraph you want to include.

Here are some example paragraphs:

[Salutation] Hello GeneriCo’s Team,

[Opening paragraph:  introduction of who you are and company specific blurb]  GeneriCo's userbase is growing fast. As a web developer with a background in Ruby, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Rails and React, I've dealt with scaling databases and leveraged my mathematics background to develop faster algorithms that enabled further growth.

[Technical skills paragraph option 1 - front end position]  I create software that is beautiful and interactive.  You can see an example of my frontend skills in my project [name/link].  I achieved the smooth user interface through careful utilization of React rendering and event listeners, and used Flexbox with React transitions for the clean, pixel-perfect look.

[Technical skills paragraph option 2 - back end position]  I create software that’s fast and functional.  Thinking about questions of optimization and hunting down bottlenecks is something I’m passionate about and well-trained for.  You can experience my skills with attacking backend problems in one of my recent projects, [name/link].  It’s built with a PostgreSQL database with a Rails backend, utilizing customized ActiveRecord queries and minimal AJAX calls for a performant app.

[Technical skills paragraph option 3 - fullstack position] I create software that’s fast, functional, and beautiful.  My skills extend across the full stack, including a variety of languages and frameworks.  In a recent project, [name/link], I used React with Redux to create a clean, interactive, optimized frontend, and Rails with a PostgreSQL database for the backend.  I’m excited to find a position in which I can add new technologies to my toolbox and refine my craft by working in all parts of the stack.

[If relevant, other skills paragraph] In addition to my programming skills, I have gained invaluable experience as a US Army pilot, flying the KC-10 on critical missions around the world. As an officer, I was entrusted with flying an $80M aircraft and leading a crew of up to 15 officers. Flexibility and the ability to react to rapidly changing situations were key skills necessary to successfully complete over 50 missions.

[Closing paragraph]  My past jobs and training have focused on quickly learning a vast array of new material and immediately applying it. I'm looking forward to contributing to an exciting and fast paced team at GenericCo.

[Signing off]  Warm regards,
Frank Matterson
