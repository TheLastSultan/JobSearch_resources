You could say my career as a programmer began way back in September 2003. This was back in
the 4th Grade, when I wrote my first lines of code programming LEGO robots after school. At
that point I was hooked. Unfortunately I am no longer fluent in the LEGO Mindstorms
language, but if you’re looking for a software developer with experience in Ruby on Rails,
JavaScript, React, and Redux, then you’ve found your man.

My experience includes a wide range of technologies across the full stack. A recent project of
mine, SoundStorm, was a full-stack single page web application based on the music sharing
platform, SoundCloud:

• The Project was built with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, React, and Redux.

• I implemented a custom modal framework using React that allowed me to
efficiently develop new forms.

• The project integrated with AWS S3 and Paperclip with the Rails backend to
store uploaded audio and images.

• For audio playback, I developed a site-wide UI that utilizes Redux actions to
sync the main audio player with waveforms and play-pause toggle buttons

Pandora has such an interesting and unique product, bringing customers new music catered for
them that they might not have heard elsewhere. I understand you’re looking for someone who
can jump right in, and I’m excited about the prospect of applying my skills as a developer to
your team.

In my three years running a web development shop, I solved problems at every stage of the product development process. 
I gained a deeper understanding of the Salesforce data integration tools when Pediafed (a healthcare GPO) hired us to build 
their automated billing system. I worked directly with the COO to integrate Salesforce Connect and automate their data processing. 
This eliminated 320 manual processing hours per quarter from their workflow, and opened my eyes to another very powerful 
side of Salesforce. 

As a software developer, I have thoroughly enjoyed rapid prototyping. Recently, I planned and executed a Pivotal Tracker 
inspired project management tool in under two weeks using Javascript, React, Ruby and Rails. It was a lot of fun building 
Trackstar using the Redux architecture. 

I am comfortable working with RESTful APIs. One of my favourite personal projects is a Google Chrome extension. I used a 
Node.js backend to handle requests to the New York Times, Eventbrite, Google Maps, and a natural language processing API to 
receive nearby concerts and positive news about cats. The extension replaces your new tab screen with all of that data (and more!) 
with an awkward moment seal background. I like to make things that make people smile. 

I excel at quickly learning new programs and immediately applying them to my personal and professional projects. I’m looking 
forward to hearing from you, and to contributing to the Salesforce Ohana.

As a Quality Engineer, I did very important work but I missed the creative freedom that was inherent in development. 
In order to re-enter that role, I have worked hard to improve my development skills with various side projects and by studying and
sharpening my skills in Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Nodejs, Java and more.

As a Goodreads member for 3 years, I have bought many books as a result of the daily deal emails I receive. I rarely 
purchase a new book without first checking its reviews on goodreads. I respect the design of your product, which deftly 
presents the user with relevant information without overwhelming them.

I have done full-stack web development both professionally and for personal projects. I recently completed a full-stack project 
using Ruby on Rails with React and Redux to replicate the key features of Slack which you can see here: https://xxxxx. I am also 
experienced with JavaScript which I have demonstrated by building a simple HTML5 canvas typing practice game inspired by the 
classic Missile Command: https://xxx/.

I have always been both eager to learn and to contribute my knowledge. I enjoy helping others understand concepts and techniques 
that I have previously learned. I thrive in collaborative environments and actively seek opportunities to contribute. For this 
reason and along with my skills, I know I could hit the ground running.

 As a bioengineer turned software developer, I like learning about logic, and have self-taught and been trained in 
 such languages as Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Writing, optimizing, and even debugging code 
 is genuinely fun for me, especially when collaborating with others. I am drawn to Airbnb because of its fast paced, 
 collaborative culture of programming.
	
One of my biggest assets is my ability to pick up new technologies rapidly. In just ten days, I built a full-stack application, 
using a Ruby on Rails backend with a PostgreSQL database and React with Redux on the front-end to create a seamless, lightning fast 
single-page app. 

Some new skills I had to teach myself in order to complete the project included sending AJAX requests to Google Maps 
and Directions Service APIs, dynamically generating search results based upon user input, and handling uploads on the front-end by 
storing images in the cloud with Cloudinary. 
	
Due to my strong work ethic and high aptitude for learning, I have achieved consistent academic success. I am confident that 
these traits combined with my software-development knowledge and sociable personality will allow me to thrive as a member of 
the team. 

Thank you for your time and consideration; I look forward to speaking with you further about the role.
