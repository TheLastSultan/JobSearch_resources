# Crafting Your Resume

## Finished Product
For your initial resume, please use one of the templates from our library.  Please copy and create your own resume from the link below:
* [online resume templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=186b8YXBheO45d4rSseYhxU4YyPzSricl)

At the end, to see how your resume is being parsed by an ATS system, paste/upload your resume and a job posting here at [Jobscan][jobscan].

**Here is your [RESUME SCORECARD](https://github.com/appacademy/sf-job-search-curriculum/blob/master/application-materials/resume/ScoreCard.md) as you will need to get 100 points.**

## Phase 0: Motivation

Every student coming out of App Academy is much better in practice than they look on paper. The goal here is to close that gap. An excellent resume will provide the opportunity to demonstrate technical expertise during phone screens and on-sites.



### Filling a Need

Imagine you are a recruiter. You need to fill positions that require certain skills and experience...

- Experience building **Single-Page Applications** in **Rails** or **Django**. Familiarity with **AWS**.

- Comfortable working with **RESTful APIs**. Experience with at least one scripting language (**Ruby**, **Python**, etc.)

- Familiar with **semantic HTML/CSS**. Experience in **object-oriented design**. Knowledge of **JavaScript** preferred.

- Must know at least one frontend technology (**React**, **Angular**, **Ember**). Knowledge of **HTTP request** lifecycle.

- Solid foundation in **computer science fundamentals**, confident with **REST APIs** (building and consuming).

This is a pretty typical scenario. Build your resume to grab a recruiter's attention.

**N.B.: If a resume can't pass the 6 second test, your portfolio will never be seen!**

## Phase 1: Layout

### General Guidelines

Use the example resumes above as guides for formatting, or customize one of our templates:  [online resume templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=186b8YXBheO45d4rSseYhxU4YyPzSricl)

You __must__ submit your Resume for review as a Google Doc or Slide. You may use a different program to build
a fancier layout if you like, but you must still submit a plain-text Google Doc to us through Jobberwocky
for review. Just include a link to the formatted PDF.

Stick to one page for a PARSEABLE resume.  If you want to use a fancier resume template from a source like Etsy, only send
the fancy resume when you are reaching out directly to a person.  Otherwise, for most purposes you will want to use 
a parseable resume with simple font and typically around 9-12 point size depending on the readability of the resume.

## Create your resume with one of our formatted templates.  Make sure to have a plain text document for yourself.

#### Order

As a general guide:

1. Skills
2. Projects
3. Education
4. Work History

This is flexible. **If you have professional software experience (i.e. you were paid to write code), place that experience first**. If you studied computer science / are a recent grad with academic achievements you may wish to give education more prominence.

#### Include these links:

* Github (at top)
* Portfolio Site (at top)
* LinkedIn (at top)
* Projects:
    * Link to live site
    * Link to Github Repo

## Phase 2: Projects

### Full Stack Project, JavaScript Project and Code Intensive

Your résumé should highlight three projects you worked on.

1. A React-on-Rails app to show you know the full stack.
2. A fun JavaScript project for non-technical reviewers to appreciate.
3. A complex, code-intensive project for technical reviewers that shows strong Object-Oriented Design skills.
    - 'code-intensive' is not an industry term, *don't write this on your resume!*

Your Full Stack Project and JavaScript Project **must** be deployed and available to view online with a live link in the resume. Otherwise they aren't serving their purpose. Projects should also include a link to their associated Github repo.

### Selling your Projects

[Read here about crafting bullet points][resume-bullets]

Follow the steps outlined above **for each bullet**. Use the following resources:
* [List of resume keywords][resume-keywords]
* [List of resume verbs][resume-verbs]

**N.B.: Every bullet should start with a verb and must include AT LEAST two resume keywords**

Your projects are one of your biggest selling points so sell them well. What
matters the most to employers are the problems you solved and the skills you applied.
Any time you had to sit back and think about a feature
before implementing it, you were solving a problem.

### Words of Caution

* Look up the proper spelling and capitalization for the technologies you mention.
    - JavaScript, not Javascript. jQuery, not jquery.

* Avoid extremely language or framework-specific bullets, they are incomprehensible unless the reader knows Rails.
   - Example: "Overwrites attr_writer on User#password"
   
* Remember, that many resumes will go through an ATS so you will want to make sure your content has searchable words that might be on a job description

* **DO NOT** just enumerate features in your bullet points!
    - Example: "Allows Users to login / logout", "Uploads photos"

### Communicate as an Engineer

A good resume item does *not* read like a feature list on a product's website. **Always write at a higher-level about what engineering solutions and features YOU implemented.** Describe *engineering problems you solved* or the solutions you found in *implementing* those features. Employers want to hear about what kind of an engineer you are and how you approach problem-solving.

### Keywords are King

[A sample resume][sans-highlights] vs. [That resume through a recruiter's eyes][highlights]


## Phase 3: Skills

List these skills, and any other relevant ones. **Anything listed is fair game in a technical interview.**

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* RSpec
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* React
* Redux
* SQL
* Git
* HTML5
* CSS3

Don't organize your skills by proficiency. Ie. Don't do this:
    Proficient: Ruby, Rails, JS
    Familiar: SQL, React

 That makes you look less confident. However it's ok to do this:
    Ruby, Rails, JS, React, C (learning)


## Phase 4: Education

### App Academy

Now that you are an App Academy student, selling yourself requires you to sell
employers on the quality of App Academy. In your
résumé, mention that App Academy is a 1000-hour coding school with an admissions
rate below 3%, which emphasizes coding style, pair programming, and best practices.

Here are some suggested bullet points for your resume. Mix and match!

* Rigorous 1000-hour software development course with <3% acceptance rate
* 1000-hour immersive full-stack web development intensive with <3% acceptance rate
* Teaches full-stack web development: Rails, SQL, JS, React, TDD, algorithms, design patterns, and programming best practices.
* Topics include: TDD, scalability, algorithms, OOP, coding style, REST, security, single-page apps, and web development best practices.

Note: if your background already includes significant engineering, coding, or startup experience, it is not necessary to include App Academy on your resume.  

### College

If you took CS-related courses in college, add a "Curriculum Highlights" section
under the name of your degree and list those courses. Linear algebra, statistics,
and Electrical Engineering courses are also relevant here.

Include your GPA if you graduated 5 years ago or less and if it's above 3.2.
If you studied a STEM subject or Econ, you can use your Major GPA if it is
higher.  (Note on GPAs: most employers won't care about them, but a few will.
This is just for them.)

### No Degree or Relevant Work Experience

Many students have graduated from App Academy without a college degree
nor relevant work experience. They are now all employed. It might be
tougher to get through the résumé screening, but the tech industry is
famous for appreciating non-traditional backgrounds.

The key in this case is to make a strong personal impression. You don't
want the reader to come away thinking "OK they can code. But I have no
idea what else to expect from this person." You have to be creative.

* Have you ever done volunteer work?
* Do you have some interesting hobbies that would make you stand out?
* It'll also be important to write enthusiastic cover letters that show
  an interest in what the company does.

If it's the case, you can mention "Left college in good
academic standing for financial reasons / to pursue web development."

## Phase 5: Work History

[Review crafting project bullet points][resume-bullets] and incorporate [action verbs][resume-verbs] in your bullets.

The difference between a compelling work history and a boring one is whether you
have identified the *results* of your work.

Someone who can talk about outcomes is someone who a) made a difference at
their job, b) cares about results, and c) is likely to
produce results at their next job.

### Quantify or Qualify

The difference between:
"Wrote financial reports" vs. "Produced quarterly financial reports, to maintain relationships with 6 major account holders."

The first is the bare minimum of what was done with no indication of how it was done or what was accomplished. The second has specific benchmarks and a reason for why it was done.

Every bullet point should be quantified and/or qualified:

**Quantify**: Numbers to measure your success. "Delivered pizzas" vs. "Delivered approx. 40 pizzas in each 4-hour shift"

**Qualify**: Specific reasons for why and how you were successful. "Served dinner" vs. "Wrote a new salad recipe that replaces bacon with cucumbers, to please a health-conscious client."

Simply describing something that sounds like success is a big plus. Consider the following blurbs.

*Wrote scripts to test new product before shipping.*

vs.

*Wrote Bash scripts to test new product before shipping. Achieved 90% test coverage, resulting in bug-free launch.*

Who knows if that's a meaningful benchmark? Maybe there weren't that many
features. Or maybe the product still had bugs and they just didn't turn up
during the launch. The key here is that you get to frame it. Position yourself as a winner.

### Quality over Quantity

Describing results takes more space. Two longer
bullet points that convey success are much stronger than four bullet
points that only describe process *no matter what portion of your
previous job you're leaving out*.

### You're an Engineer Now

If you did coding-like technical things, talk about it. Whether
that be scripting, Excel analyses, financial crunching, SQL queries, whatever. Technical
experience helps smooth out the narrative of your transition into engineering.

## Phase 6: Review

Before you submit your résumé for review, make sure you can answer yes to all these questions.

**N.B. Address these so your career coach can give substantive personal feedback instead of rehashing project guidelines**

* Layout
  Resume fits on 1 page?
  0. 1/2 to 1-inch margins on left and right?
  0. Margins and formatting are consistent and organized?
  0. All text point sizes are consistent
  0. Uses a nicer font than defaults?
  
  You should also have a **plain text resume** as well

* Projects
  0. Do you list three or four coding projects, including your Full Stack Project, JavaScript project, and Code Intensive?
  0. Does each project include a link to the Github repo and one to the live demo (if applicable)?
  0. Do you describe clever solutions you came up with to build each project?
  0. Does each bullet include at least two [keywords][resume-keywords]?

* Work
  0. Do you describe not just *what* you did at each job but *how well* you did it?
  0. Do you provide benchmarks for your own or your teams success?
  0. Do you emphasize technical or programmatic aspects of your work history?

* Misc 
  0. Do your bullets follow the formula of saying what YOU DID vs. FEATURES: 
  ie. Developed collision detection algorithm for sprite characters, and integrated with keystroke event listeners to seamlessly predict future player direction and movement.
  0. Do you provide a skills list of the technologies you are familiar with?
  0. Do you provide contact information and link to your Github and LinkedIn?
  0. Does your contact information make it clear you are currently in the metro area? (Use a/A office address if this is not the case)
  0. Is it a Google Doc where you have granted edit access for your career coach?
  0. Have you eliminated or minimized any timeline gaps in your resume?
