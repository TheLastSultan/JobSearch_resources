# Crafting Resume Bullets

The primary purpose of your resume is to demonstrate to a recruiter that you possess specific
skills. Recruiters spend only a few seconds glancing over your resume so you have to rely on
keywords to tell the story.

## Steps to take

1. Identify a key skill that you will demonstrate. See [this list][keywords] for ideas.
2. Answer the following for each bullet:
  * What did I do?
  * How does it demonstrate the key skill?
  * What was the impact or benefit?

**Steps to take:**
A. Identify a key skill or technology you want to demonstrate knowledge in.

B. Pick a feature from one of your projects that either was enabled by said technology or let you use the skill you want to demonstrate.

C. Use the skill and feature in a bullet point that tells us how you implemented said feature using said skill/technology. Your goal is to demonstrate that you understand how that skill/technology actually works from an engineering standpoint.

Examples:

<b>Skill: APIs</b>
Feature: Global on-off switch

<i>Designed global on-off switch & dimmer React-Native components by making HTTP post requests to the Phillips Hue API changing the state of the bulbs in turn.</i>

<b>Skill: UI/UX Design</b>
Feature: Drag and drop canvas for lightbulbs

<i>Developed a smooth, intuitive UI with high usability by leveraging the React-Native PanResponder Library to allow users to map bulbs to their physical space in their room</i>

<b>Skill: JS Promises & Async Functions </b>
Feature: Saving user preferences

<i>Implemented scenes feature to allow users to save their current settings by utilizing React-Nativeâ€™s AsyncStorage library & JavaScript promises to fetch & store data asynchronously</i>

Compile a list of the skills you want to demonstrate, then craft your bullets around them.

### Example 1 (Non technical)
__Skill to Demonstrate__: Leadership

__What did I do?__: Founded company softball team

__How does it demonstrate the key skill?__: Took initiative. Organized long-term project.

__What was the impact or benefit?__: Improved team morale and collaboration.

__Result__: "Founded and managed company softball team, resulting in improved morale and communication."

**Software related skills**
* Anything you coded.  Even if it was brief or unfinished or unofficial
* Quantitative analysis / handling data
* Improvements to a website 

**Recognition**
* Published something
* Gave a talk
* Won an award
* Given a new responsibility or job title

**Interpersonal skills**
* Were part of a team
* Handled heavy volume of customer...
* Mentored someone
* Made clients happy
* Made coworkers happy
* Attracted customers
* Negotiated something

**Output**
* Made something faster or better
* Reduced number of errors
* Took initiative to do something
* Delivered project on time

**Money**
* Made or saved money
* Handled lots of money (or widgets worth a lot of money)
* Delivered project within budget


### Example 2 (Technical)

## TECHNICAL SKILLS IMPORTANT NOTE:  When writing, try not to discuss a feature, but try to let the reader know about the feature and what YOU did to make it happen!

__Skill to Demonstrate__: Scaling an App

__What did I do?__: Stored images in the cloud.

__How does it demonstrate the key skill?__: Shows I know how to use AWS S3.

__What was the impact or benefit?__: Reduces server load and allows for scale.

__Result__: "Stores image uploads in the cloud using AWS S3, reducing server load and allowing app to scale gracefully."

## Example 3 (Technical)
__Skill to Demonstrate__: Use of Third-Party API.

__What did I do?__: Determine user locations and filter searches.

__How does it demonstrate the key skill?__: Shows I know how to use the Google Maps API.

__What was the impact or benefit?__: Allows users to search for each other based on location

__Result__: "Integrates Google Maps API with geolocation based searching to display location of other users on a map."

## Notes from a Technical Coach:

Bullet points should be substantive.  A good pattern to follow is the following:

<b> GOOD:</b>
<b> "Used [technology] to implement [feature/idea/functionality] allowing for [very brief description of the capabilities]"</b>


Example: <i>"Utilized AWS S3 and the Paperclip gem to implement user image uploads reducing server load and allowing for scalability of image services." </i>

We do not want to you use overly simple, un-substantive, or all jargon bullet points. We also do not want to simply describe what our apps do:

<b> BAD:</b>

"Implemented CRUD functionality for note taking."

"Persisted user data with AJAX requests to the Rails backend"

"Leveraged ActiveRecord in Rails to make queries to the PostgreSQL database and generate JSON views with the jBuilder gem."

-Technical language that's too casual.

<b> BAD:</b>
"Vanilla"
"Hand rolled"
"..in 2 weeks"

> We want to <b>avoid terms like 'handrolled' and 'vanilla' in a resume.</b>  They are fine in conversation, but don't read well on a resume.  Instead use words like 'custom'  or say that you 'designed' or 'implemented' the idea or technology in question.  Rather than say 'vanilla' you can use the term 'basic' in some cases  (like when you build your own middleware from basic javascript) or simply say the name of the tech or library without any qualifiers.  It conveys the same message.

> Also, <b>do not want to talk about the amount of time it took to build apps or their features.</b>  It does not read as impressive when you say "Implemented music sharing functionality in 2 weeks."  If you want to highlight an impressive time constraint (say, 48 hours for a fullstack app at a hackathon) Include the name of the event/the amount of time you took to build it in parenthesis in the description of the app before the bullet points, BUT DO THIS SPARINGLY.

### To help get you brainstorming:
 
* Did you find some clever way to DRY up your code?
* Did you bootstrap some data to avoid extraneous AJAX requests?
* Did you make some tough choices in your database schema?
* Did you use cookies to store anything other than a session token?
* Does your Javascript use any math to resize something in the DOM?
* Did you use a library in a way that its author probably didn't anticipate?
* Do you have any data that's nested one degree deeper than usual?
* Did you override a Rails or Backbone.js method? (eg. Model#parse or Model#as_json)
* Do your ActiveRecord models run any custom SQL queries?
* Did you make any trade-offs related to performance, eg. store information that's costly to compute?
* Are you doing any caching?
* Do you make AJAX requests to any unexpected routes?
* Did you write a custom CompositeView class with a recursive #remove method?
* Does your chess game make a recursive deep_dup to validate moves without modifying the game state?
* Do your chess pieces inherit from a Slideable and Steppable class?


When answering these questions, the key is to point out features you built that went **above and beyond the basic requirements**.
