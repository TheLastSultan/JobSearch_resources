## Getting the Green: Keep Your Github Impressive

A common practice among technical recruiters is to look through your Github profile.  You're especially likely to be subject to this as a bootcamp grad.  Why?  Because as someone who is new to software development and who has never worked professionally, your Github provides the only evidence of your competence as a developer.  Employers want to see that you're staying sharp even after a/A ended, and that you're enthusiastic enough about coding to keep doing it outside of the classroom.

As with most of your application materials, recruiters will likely only take a brief look at your Github.  It's unlikely that anyone will dig deeply into your code -- an engineer who's about to interview you may look at a few files in a repository or two, but usually not.  More often, an employer will hop onto your Github, look at your **green squares**, and may take a look at your Readmes for the first couple repositories that appear.

### Green Squares

As you know by now, Github records the frequency with which you commit by showing green squares on your Contribution History.  This is by no means a perfect measure of how much you're coding, but it's an easy one for recruiters, so they use it.  Compare these three Github histories:

![Frequent contributer green squares](https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/job-search/application-materials/github/images/green_squares1.png)

Which person would you interview, all else being equal?  To make your profile green:
- Commit everyday, and commit often during the day
- Change your settings to show both private and public contributions, especially if any of your repositories are private (NOT recommended during the job search) or if you're contributing to someone else's project

## Make it personal
* A strongly branded Github is more welcoming and tells employers you
  care about the code you publish.
* Add your first name and last name under *settings > profile*. This
  makes it easier for employers to find you and review your code.
* Make sure you have a decent profile picture (nothing indecent! Be fully clothed, not drinking or doing something else unsavory, and the pic should be only you)

## Pinned Repos

Github gives you the option to pin up to 6 repos so that they show up on your profile page.  Pin the repos of all the projects on your resume, and fill in the rest with other good repos.  Write a README for each of these that describes the project's purpose, what you accomplished, and (if applicable) how to run the code or where to find a live version.  Some a/A repos to choose from:

- RailsLite or ActiveRecord Lite
- Chess
- Asteroids or Snake
- Ruby recursion exercises

Students sometimes have other good repos from before (or during) App Academy.  For example:

- Code from a dissertation or graduate thesis (doesn't have to be a degree in CS)
- HackerRank, CodeWars, Project Euler, or other "challenge" problem solutions
- Code from a personal project from before a/A

Once you have solutions to your algorithms projects up, you should pin that repo as well.
