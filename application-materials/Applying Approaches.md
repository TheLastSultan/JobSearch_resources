# DIVERSIFY YOUR SEARCH

It seems like many job seekers are only looking on AngelList, Indeed and LinkedIn.  Time to diversify!  Please use Google search 
(ie. Software developer jobs Bay area.  Ruby jobs San Francisco) as it aggregates many various platforms and you can really 
customize your search based on the type of job you are seeking, area, date job was posted.  

Also, remember...**Many companies do not put their jobs on specialty sites.  When applying, please also go to company websites and 
their Career pages.**

# GET PERSONAL

Here is what I am noticing.  Job seekers who are reaching out directly to people are getting a higher percentage of responses.  
Here's how.

> Apply for a job

> Go to LinkedIn and find out who the recruiters/engineers are

> Get CLEARBIT CONNECT which is a free Chrome extension

> Get DIRECT EMAIL ADDRESSES

Then...

Use an amazing Subject Line so you get noticed.  Do not be shy.  Personalize it.  Examples:

*"Looking for an awesome developer?  My name is _____"*

*"Hey Joe.  Amazing Front End Developer Here.  I'm (insert name here)*

*"Sue, I'm Joan Smith.  Software Engineer.  Check me out."*

Be bold or go home.  What might make you stand out?  If they do not open your email, no harm done.  
If they do....hopefully they call.

### It is recommended to email ALL THE RECRUITERS AT A COMPANY.  

> a) It will show them you are interested in a position and 

> b) you never know what other roles they might be hiring for.  Following is a sample email you can write:

**_Hi (Name here)_**

**_Today I applied for the Software Developer position I saw on XXXXX and noticed you are a Recruiter at Amazing Company.  While I do 
not know if you are the right person to connect with I definitely have the  (Ruby, Front end, Full Stack, Angular, etc.) experience 
that your team is seeking.  I am a skilled developer who can code quickly and also believe I would be a great fit for 
your team who could hit the ground running._**

**_I know you are super busy, but I would really enjoy the opportunity to hop on a quick Skype/call to learn more about what 
roles you and your team are recruiting for and to learn more about you and the company.  Might you be free to chat for 15 minutes 
this week?_**

**_In advance, I have attached my resume for your review and really appreciate your consideration and look forward 
to hearing from you._**
