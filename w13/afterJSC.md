## General Advice from Successful Alums
* Keep coding. Read about the importance of an [impressive Github][github].
* Even after being excused from roll call when you hit 150 apps, continue coming back into the office. Students that search from the office have a better work environment and find jobs faster.
* Make a daily plan and create concrete, actionable goals for each hour.
* Balance your time well between all the different parts of the job search.
