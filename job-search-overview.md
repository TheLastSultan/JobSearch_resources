# Job Search Overview

This repository contains the curriculum for the last four weeks of App Academy. The structure of the job search is less rigid than that of previous curricula, so it's important to know what's expected of you. 

We have organized the curriculum into sections by week and by the different types of projects that you all will be working on as part of this curriculum. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the resources we've provided and where everything is located.
