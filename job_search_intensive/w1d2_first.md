## Pair Programming for Submission
### Palindrome Dictionary (60 mins)
Given a dictionary of all words in the english language, return all word pairs that, when concatenated, form a palindrome

Optimum time complexity is `O(n*k^2)` where `n` is the number of words in the dictionary, and `k` is the average length of word.

HINT: given ['badd', 'ab', 'bada'], what aspect of 'badd' makes 'baddab' a palindrome, but 'badaab' is not?

BONUS: How can you use Tries to solve this problem?
