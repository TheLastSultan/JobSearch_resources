Explain the Lifecycle methods in React

[Lifecycle methods] (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)

### Spiralize (40 mins)
Given an integer as input, write a function that will draw (print out on the command line) a spiral starting with that integer length of each side, spiraling inward with space of one character between all walls.

Example: input 6 looks like this
```
||||||
     |
|||| |
|  | |
|    |
||||||
```
Example: input 8 looks like this
```
||||||||
       |
|||||| |
|    | |
| |  | |
| |||| |
|      |
||||||||
```
Example: input 12 looks like this
```
||||||||||||
           |
|||||||||| |
|        | |
| |||||| | |
| |    | | |
| | |  | | |
| | |||| | |
| |      | |
| |||||||| |
|          |
||||||||||||
```

### Solution
Make a matrix and populate it appropriately ;) Or develop an algorithm. What do you notice about rows 0-3 in the three examples? Can you start to generalize a pattern? Brainstorm with your interviewee
