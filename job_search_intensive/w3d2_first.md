## Pair Programming

### Shuffle without rand() (45 mins)
You have a deck of 52 cards.  Please shuffle in a random fashion without using Math.rand. Come up with 3 different approaches.

### PromiseDotAll (60 mins)
Write a function called promiseDotAll. This function takes in an array of promise objects. Check to see if the promises are all resolved.  If everything resolves, output a success message.  If not, then output a fail message. Don't use Promise.all `XD`
