## W12D1
### Homework & Daily Tasks
* **[Flex Project][flex-project] due at 9am**.
  * Turn it in on [Jobberwocky][Jobberwocky].
* **Read a/A's requirements for [sending applications][applying-for-jobs].**
* Begin to implement instructor feedback on your projects.
* Read [Big O Readings][big-o-readings].
* [**Math for Programmers**][math-primer], a math primer video lecture for those without math backgrounds. Will cover what you need to know for algorithms lectures this week.
  * **Required** for anyone who hasn't studied or worked in a math-heavy field. Those with math backgrounds can skip.
  * Specific topics covered:
    * definition of mathematical functions used in Big O analysis (constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, factorial)
    * definition and examples of base-2 (binary) notation
    * important facts in discrete math such as 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n-1)/2


### Morning

* Algorithms mini-course begins
* Lecture: Introduction to Time Complexity
* Project: [Big O practice][big-o-practice]

### Afternoon

* [Pair Boarding][pair-boarding-index] from `1:30 - 3:00`
* Start watching the [Static Array video][static-arrays] and [Dynamic Array video][dynamic-arrays] videos from `3:00-4:00`
* [Networking](https://github.com/appacademy/sf-job-search-curriculum/blob/master/soft-skills/networking/networking.md) Lecture and Workshop from `4 - 6pm`.
* Dynamic Array Project will go live on Jobberwocky at 3:00pm today!
    * **First watch the videos**
    * **Then, go through the [Dynamic Arrays Reading][dynamic-array-reading]**
    * **Finally, do the project (download from Progress Tracker Assessments section), using the videos and reading as a guide.**
    * **Turn in Dynamic Array Project on Progress Tracker before noon tomorrow**

### Evening

* Tuesday roll call at 10am -- sleep in!

### Bonus

* **Bonus: [Memory and Assembly][memory-assembly-lecture]**
  * Password is `go_video_go`
* Do some practice problems on [HackerRank][HackerRank] or [Codility][Codility].
* Begin to read and practice from [Elements of Programming Interviews][elements-book]
