## W12D6-7
### Projects
* Binary Search Tree Project due Monday
* Bonus: [portfolio site][portfolio]


### Resources for Ongoing Study
* Find online algorithms lectures or see this [Coursera course][Coursera].
* Practice [these algorithms tests][algo-specs]
* Learn about [architecture, scalability][hiredintech] and [systems design][systemsdesign].
* Check out the repo that Raymond Lee put together for [studying systems design and architecture][raymond-arch] (and give his repo a star!)
* Most importantly, keep coding.  Read about the importance of an [impressive Github][github].
