# Instructions for Uploading Personal Pitch Video

1. Record yourself giving the pitch
  * For Mac users, the Photo Booth app is an easy way to record
  * You could also use your smart phone's camera to record and then upload it to your laptop
2. Some considerations as you’re recording yourself:
  * Give your pitch as if you were giving it to an interviewer
  * Did you cover the four stages?
    1. Interest in tech
    2. When you decided to pursue tech more seriously
    3. Skills and accomplishments
    4. Something company-specific (pretend you are applying to your dream company)
  * Be specific!
  * Be concise (1- 1.5 min)
  * Sound confident.
  * Prefer silence over filler words
3. Feel free to re-record yourself as many times as you want until you are satisfied. Use this as a learning experience—watching yourself can be one of the best ways to get better at a personal pitch since we’re often our own harshest critic!
