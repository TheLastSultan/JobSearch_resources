# Adding `will_apply` Applications to Jobberwocky

Every day, add 10 companies to [Jobberwocky][jobberwocky], marked as `will_apply`
  * While you're researching the company, craft your [company blurb][cover-letter].
  * To find companies, see the Companies tab in Jobberwocky, the Tech Companies spreadsheets ([NY][ny-tech-companies] & [SF][bay-tech-companies]) or any [job board][job-boards].
  * Rank companies 1 to 3.
    * 3 means "Not dying to work there" or "Don't know enough about them". Should be 45-55% of them.
    * 2 means "Looks like a cool place". Should be 35-40% of them.
    * 1 means "Want to work there". Should be 10-15%
