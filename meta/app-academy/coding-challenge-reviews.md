# Coding Challenge Reviews

App Academy offers reviews of coding challenges to job seekers. This is a great way to identify problems in your approach to coding challenges in preparation for future challenges.

* Coding Challenge reviews will only be done once the project has been finished and submitted.
* Reviews will be limited to 15-30 minutes with a focus on coding style, design decisions, and other forward-applicable skills. If you have specific questions, include them in your request.
* Coding challenge reviews are not possible on projects intended to be kept private. The presence of any applicable NDAs or verbal or written requests for privacy will be honored. Do not submit any coding challenge that a company has asked you not to share.
* App Academy will never share submitted coding challenge prompts or solutions, though we may generalize advice based on common patterns we identify.

To submit a coding challenge for review, email [jtso@appacademy.io](mailto:jtso@appacademy.io) with a zipped copy of your completed challenge. There is no guarantee for any particular timeline for the feedback, but if you have a request, include it in the email. By submitting, you confirm that the company has not asked you to not share the coding challenge.
