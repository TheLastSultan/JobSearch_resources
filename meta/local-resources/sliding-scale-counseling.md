# Low-Cost Local Life Counseling Services

Sliding scale counseling services are variable prices for services based on a customer's ability to pay.
Such fees are thereby reduced for those who have lower incomes, or alternatively, less money to spare after their personal expenses, regardless of income. We have picked these counseling services because they are located around San Francisco and Berkeley. Feel free to contact them and schedule an intake appointment.
