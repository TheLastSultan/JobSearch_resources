# Phone Screen Mock Interview

Welcome to your first (and only) mock phone screen practice today! 

## Areas of Focus

Today, as an interviewer, pay close attention to the communication skills of
your partner, and be very intentional about giving critical, constructive feedback.
This is especially important today because as you know, body language is a HUGE
part of communication, and with phone screens, we obviously lose that huge component.

That means no reading their facial expressions and non-verbal cues to be able to
tell whether or not you're doing well on the interview, and that can be nerve-wracking.

That's why today, let's help each other out in making sure that our verbal communication
is excellent, and if it's not, provide feedback on how to get there.

## Instructions

* **Before starting the interview, decide which company you are going to pretend
that you are talking to on the phone interview today.**

* **In addition, before starting the interview, please review the questions you
are about to give (especially the technical ones) to make sure you understand
them fully before asking them.**

* Both people should set up this scorecard in their own job search drive:
[Phone Screen Scorecard][scorecard]

* Share edit access on the scorecard with each other.



Some areas to pay attention to and give specific feedback on:
1. Did they drone on for too long?
2. Did they speak clearly, with volume, and with good pacing?
3. Did it feel natural (almost conversational)? Or was it awkward and forced?
4. Were their answers organized?
    * For example, if it's a non-technical question, did they follow the PAR format?
    * Did they give answers that would convince you that they are someone you would
    want to work with?
    * If it's technical, were the concrete and concise? Did they give specific 
    examples to demonstrate the depth of their knowledge?
5. Did they rush into answering the question? Or did they take a pause (but not too long) to come up with a well thought out answer?
