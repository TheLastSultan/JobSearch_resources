9. Do you have any questions for me? 

**Number 9 is important! You should always have a go-to list of questions that
you feel good about asking someone.** This is
a great place to be able to ask intelligent/thoughtful questions to really
establish yourself as a peer to an engineer. Of, if you're talking to a recruiter,
it can be your opportunity to show that you've done your homework about ther company.
