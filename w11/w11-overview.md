# Week 11 Overview

Welcome to JavaScript project week! You've had a lot of practice writing JavaScript already - between weeks 5-6 of the curriculum and your MERN Stack Project, by now you have a toolkit that will allow you to put a lot of focus on the end product. Being less than two weeks away from graduation, we expect you to take the initiative and be in charge of your own project. You have the freedom this week to build something fun, so take advantage of that and choose a JavaScript project which interests you. We recommend building a game, but some students prefer to make data visualization or mathematics-related projects.

You will have our support during office hours, but by now you should be doing your best to solve problems on your own before you ask for help in the placements queue. You need to foster a sense of independence for your job search.

This week we will also be continuing our data structures and algorithms mini-course. Feel free to bring your laptops to class and follow along with the lecture - we will be providing solution files ahead of time. The important thing is that you come away with an understanding of how the data structure works in code and its time and space complexities.

You will gain an understanding of continuous integration with a dev ops lecture from our very own App Academy engineering team. Additionally, you will begin to think about your social media image with a lecture on online presence.

## JavaScript Project Timeline

Place a high priority on OOP, aesthetics, and usability. Since every project is different, you will need to create your own implementation timeline. Strive to have the majority of your project done by Friday so that you can spend the weekend testing, debugging, and making sure your project is live.

Monday morning: project introduction and proposal draft work time
Monday evening: review readings and finish proposal
Tuesday morning: Proposal due 9AM
Tuesday - Friday: Follow your implementation timeline and complete all MVPs
Saturday: Testing, debugging, bonus features
Sunday: Deploy your project on GitHub Pages or Netlify (we reccomend buying a custom URL)

## Algorithms and Data Structures

Monday afternoon: Binary Search Tree Lecture
Wednesday morning: BST Mini Assessment
Wednesday lunchtime: A* (optional)
Wednesday afternoon: Graphs and Topological Sort Lecture
Friday morning: Topological Sort Mini Assessment
Friday afternoon: Dynamic Programming Lecture
