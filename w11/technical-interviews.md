# Technical Interviewing
## How to present yourself as a hireable candidate

---

## Agenda

* What are employers looking for?
* The application pipeline
* Successful interviewing
* Answering trivia questions
* Practical challenges
* After the interview
* Pairboarding

---

## What are employers looking for?

* Ability to work through a difficult problem and utilize different tools
* Good design decision making -- clean, readable, maintainable code
* Familiarity with a variety of “basics” that all software developers should know
* Good communication skills & fit with team members  

Note:
Passing a technical interview is about knowing the right stuff and communicating that you know it

---

## The application pipeline

* Phone Screen (20-45 minutes)
* Coding challenge or project (2-8 hours)
* Technical phone or video screen (45-60 minutes)
* Onsite (3-6 hours)

---

## General advice for phone screens

* Don’t rush
* If it’s technical, have something to write on- “Writing things down helps me keep track of my thoughts, would it be cool if I jotted things along the way as I explain?”
* If it’s behavioral, have your PAR chart in front of you!

---

## General advice for technical challenges

* Coding style and presentation
* Efficiency and modularity
* Good documentation
* Write tests!! (new workshop for this on W13)

---

## General advice for onsites

* Ask clarifying questions
* Communicate your approach
* Communicate throughout
* Write examples
* Clean coding style and presentation
* Be mindful of time and space complexity
* Provide alternatives
  * Efficiency
  * Modularity
* Be persistent - NEVER GIVE UP!

---

## Live Coding

* The “classic” way to interview a software developer
* Sometimes done on a whiteboard, sometimes with screen share software

---

## Example Problem

```You have a linked list and you want to find the kth to last node. Write a function kth_to_last_node that takes an integer k and the head_node of a linked list, and returns the kth to the last node in the list.```

---

## Live Coding - How to Do Well

* Understand (30%)
* Plan (45%)
* Code (25%)
* Test and Analyze (100%)

---

## Understand

* Restate the problem
* Ask clarifying questions
* **Example inputs and outputs**
* Talk/ask about edge cases

---

## Understand
### Partner A: Restate the question

* Do it in your own words
* Eliminate misunderstandings
* Buys you time

---

## Understand
### Parner B: Ask clarifying questions

What are some clarifying questions for this linked list problem?

---

## Understand
### Both: Example IO/Test cases

---

## Plan

* Brainstorm
* Test/analyze
* Pseudocode

---

## Plan
### Brainstorm

* Brainstorm different approaches
* Write them down in English
* Think critically about your approach
* Consider alternatives

---

## Plan
### Test/analyze

* Does it work with your example inputs?
* Time and Space Complexity
* Pick the best one

---

## Plan
### Pseudocode

---

## Code

* Explain, write, turn
* Analyze throughout
* Leave enough space
* Be persistent

---

## Code
### Test/analyze

* Walk through your code
* Walk through an example
* Check for edge cases
* Discuss time complexity

---

# Solution

---

## Live coding: how to prepare

* Daily
    * 1 Cracking the Coding Interview or Elements of Programming Interview problem
    * 1 Leetcode or Hackerrank problem
    * Continue to study algorithms and data structures
* Weekly
    * 2 [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/promo/app-academy) interviews
* Take notes on your own practice & study - what techniques are you using? When do you use them?
* Other great resources: Codility, InterviewCake, MIT, Stanford, Princeton, Coursera, YouTube

## Knowledge and Trivia

* JavaScript
* Rails
* Ruby
* SQL
* HTML/CSS
* React/Redux
* Web

---

## Examples

* What is the event loop? How does it work?
* What happens when you type in ‘www.google.com’ and hit enter?
* Talk about the 4 types of positions in CSS
* What's your favorite thing about your favorite language?
* What is a load balancer?
* What does it mean for a web page to be responsive?
* What is a hashmap? How is it different from a hash table?
* What are the differences between XSS and CSRF?

---

## Succeeding at trivia

* Take a couple of moments to think
* Structure your responses
* Make a thesis statement
* Use an example to illustrate the idea
    * Example should be small and show benefits of tool/concept

---

## Practical Coding Challenges

* Build Something
* Make calls to an API
* Debug
* Refactor

---

## Project Examples

* Build tic-tac-toe in React
* Build a digital clock using only vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS
* Here’s some broken code - fix it

---

## Live Coding Tips

* Waste as little time as possible on setup
* Practice effective communication
* Remember to test
* Analyze along the way

---

## Succeeding at practical challenges


* Keep coding - don’t let your skills get stale
* Spend 2.5 hours working on projects or practical coding challenges per day
* Focus on deepening your understanding as you code
* [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)
* Hackathons

---

## Architecture and systems design

* Typically big, vague, broad questions  
* Often times more pseudocode and high level discussion than actual coding
* Practice good judgement and thoughtfulness in design
* Be aware of what’s out there

---

## Examples

* How would you design a URL shortener?
* Design Twitter
* How does a website scale?

---

## Succeeding at Architecture Questions

* Start with making sure you understand the end goal
* Make it conversational
* Diagrams and visuals (use whiteboard or paper)

---

## Preparing for Architecture Questions

* Read 1 High Scalability article per day to get acquainted with the different tools available and their strengths/weaknesses.
* Be ready for the frequently asked questions
* Practice doing this with your everyday websites
* Youtube series on System Design

---

## After the Interview

* Always do a debrief
    * What questions did you struggle with and why?
    * What topics came up?
    * Go one level deeper
* Interview DB
* Get feedback if you can
* Follow up with your interviewer
* Don’t take rejection personally; learn from it and push forward
* Keep studying!

---

## Being a Helpful Pair

* Explain the problem clearly
* Add parameters if necessary
* Don’t give hints
* Ask clarifying questions
* Let them struggle, but only toward a solution

---

## Providing Feedback

* Give complete responses
* Provide a path forward
* Stay positive
* Do not avoid or soften criticism
* Don’t make assumptions
