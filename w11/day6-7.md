## W11D6-7

### Projects
* **[Flex Project][flex-project], due Monday at 9am**
  * Please make sure all group members have uploaded their live url to Jobberwocky and hit "Queue for review"
  * **Remember, presentation is extremely important!**
    * All "Non-live" apps (anything that must be downloaded) **must have** demo pages with links to the actual download page.
    * Mobile apps **must have** have a demo page that contains a link to an [emulator][emulator]. (It must be eventually placed on the app store. Looks much more impressive and legitimate to recruiters.)
    * **Everyone should place a high priority on aesthetics, UI, and UX.**
