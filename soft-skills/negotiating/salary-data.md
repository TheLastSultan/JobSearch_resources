# What do Web Developers Make?

Let's consider the data. Keep in mind that you are more mid-level than junior when you come out of App Academy. Junior means you know how to program and can pick up Rails in the first few months of the job. Mid-level means you've built Rails apps before so you can already debug and implement features.    

You don't need to bring up these references directly during
negotiations, but being familiar with them should be helpful.    

*NB: Do not bring up App Academy averages unless you know the company has already
hired several a/A grads. Those numbers don't mean anything to most companies and
are too easy to deflect.*
