# Prepare your Pitch

"So, tell me about yourself. What have you done in your career and what brought you here?"

Unnatural as it feels, this formality will likely be the first question you get in an interview.  Since your answer will also be longer than most parts of the conversation, your interviewer is likely to sit back, listen to you talk, and decide whether to take your candidacy seriously.  Depending on your interviewer, this can significantly affect the outcome of the entire conversation.  

If you're good at selling yourself, this is where you shine. Otherwise no worries. A 2 minute, well-rehearsed spiel is all you need to sound prepared and professional.

### YOUR TRIANGLE
What are the three points you want your interviewer to remember.  As per our discussion try to use these ideas:
1.  How did you get started in the industry? or Why did you want to become a developer?

2.  What languages do you know?  Discuss one or two (max) projects you have worked on.

3.  Something about you and the company and what and how you specifically bring value.  ie "I know you work on XYZ stacks and with my experience on ABC project I know I would easily be able to integrate with your team and hit the ground running." or "The reason I really would like to work for XYZ company as I share your companies core values, especially......"

Remember...the importance of three.  Keep this easy, fun and simple for you and your interviewer(s)

## Brainstorming

Before crafting your pitch, ask yourself these questions:

* When did you write your first line of code? Writing BASIC functions on your TI graphing calculator in middle school counts. That’s how a lot of successful programmers got started.
* Why did you choose to major in X?
* How did you decide on web development?
* How do your major and web development relate in your mind (Get creative)
* What online resources did you use before applying to App Academy?


## Your 60-second life's story...more ideas

Your life story should be just that -- *a story.*  It should have a beginning, middle, and end.  Each piece should be concrete and specific.  Start with one of the first times you encountered code (or some type of problem solving that is tech-related).  Then describe your transition into web development.  At the end, bring your listener to the present: you are a trained web developer ready to start working for their company.  

 A sample outline for your inspiration:
(beginning)
* *Beginning:* "In college I chose to major in [...] and took a lot of classes in [...] because I like working on problems that involve [...].  At [company] I accomplished [...] and [...]. While I was at it I learned [...]."
* *Middle:* "I've always had an affinity for computers so I taught myself HTML and JavaScript for fun.  When I picked up Ruby two years ago, I immediately got hooked.  I was playing around on Ruby Monk every day after work.  I wanted to take it to the next level so I took some classes."
    * Bring up App Academy if they ask for details. Also mention online courses like Coursera, Ruby Monk, etc.
* *End:* "I've now built two games in JavaScript and one full-stack web app using Bootstrap and Rails.  I want to join [company] because [...]."

Notice that each part of the story includes specific details such as time/place, projects, and accomplishments.  A few specifics are critical for your listener to fully understand your story.

## HELPFUL TIP 1:  
When creating your personal pitch keep in mind that about 40% should be about you and 60% should be about your life/experience as a developer (How you got started, what you have done/are working on, why you love the industry, etc.) BE SPECIFIC...what have you done tech related (ie.  HTML, CSS, C, Java).

## HELPFUL TIP 2:
Your pitch IS important.  The best way to practice are as follows:
PHONE SCREENS:  Record yourself on your phone so you can hear what you sound like.  Are you loud and clear?  Do you have filler words?  Talking too fast?  Listen as a Recruiter would hear you for the first time

## ON SITE ##
Same as above but also have someone practice with you and video yourself.  Do you have good eye contact?  (Practice with some sticky pads and make eyes on them, put them around the room) Volume?  Fidgety?

As adults we learn quicker when we can see and hear ourselves.
